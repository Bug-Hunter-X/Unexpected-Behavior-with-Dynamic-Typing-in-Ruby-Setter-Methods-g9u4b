# Ruby Dynamic Typing Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon code error in Ruby related to the dynamic typing of instance variables.  The `MyClass` example shows how assigning different data types to an instance variable can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled appropriately.  The `bugSolution.rb` file provides a refined version with type checking.
